Exploratory Data Analysis
In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing 
data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. 
A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what 
the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. 
Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians 
to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new 
data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA),
which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and 
hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables 
as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.
